# Git Workflow

The goal of this project is to explain a basic Git workflow.

## Create a new repository

- On GitHub, create a repo called: `git-workflow`.
- Then on the local computer, create a folder that contains `index.html` and `README.md`.
- Note: index.html should include a simple boilerplate.
- Initialize project and push to GitHub.
